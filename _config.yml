          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>K3D</mark> and it has since grown into a fully k8s Mini monster. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          I Remember the times when developer wanted to provision a set of AWS assets without knowing terraform , so i created them a small tool for it :-) 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          As terraform became a key player in the all infra levels on all providers , more and more developers wanted to create resources without playing with HCL. thats how this was born .

            Every company needs its infra and networks properly administered and Locusview is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the RND keeps pushing code while our infra scales out to support it . Iv'e  lead a major change in embracing a TRUE infra as code methodology .
            While on AWS as a provider , Jenkins , GitHub actions and ECS (CodePipeline), we allowed a flexible Dev -> Prod changes with MINIMUM of breaking changes ( dont recall i had any LOL  ).
