# Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

[VladiR](https://github.com/VladiR) is a small project that contains tools we use in our daily work. All the tools are licensed under MIT.
You are welcome to contribute to our project, help is appreciated.

If you have any questions you can contact project administrators: [Alexander Pazdnikov](https://github.com/apazdnikov), [Timur Gilmullin](https://github.com/Tim55667757) and [Aleksey Burov](https://github.com/orgs/VladiR/people/allburov). 

**Our goal** is to have open source solutions for various aspects of Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), such as development, testing, delivery, deployment and licensing. 
We want to:
1. Accumulate knowledge related to Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) methodologies and best practices.
2. Design and develop tools for continuous ALM support: from committing a line of code to deploying an app at the customer's infrastructure.
3. Organize existing CI/CD solutions into a fully-functional system.
4. Unite developers and companies around that such ALM system.

We also want our tools to be accessible as easily as possible by software companies and individual developers alike.
